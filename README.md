# society-mail-automation
Created this to automate the task of sending maintenance bill emails to respective flat owners in my apartment.

Here's how it works:
1. Downloads the zip attachment from the management containing bills 
2. Unzips the file
3. Associates the filename with the correspoding owner and it's email stored in the contacts.txt file
4. Sends a personalised email to everyone.
5. Delete's the zip file from your local system after sending all the emails
